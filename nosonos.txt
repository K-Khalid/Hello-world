WiFi hacking with reaver[android] 
=======================================================
1.Look if you have a Broadcom bcm4329 or bcm 4330 chipest on your android phone or not.
2.bcmon (it helps monitor mode on your broadcom chipest that helps in the PIN Cracking.) = download 
{https://code.google.com/p/bcmon/downloads/detail?name=bcmon.apk}
3.After installation, run the app and tap "monitor mode" option.
4.Download and Install Reaver app(http://webservices.aptoide.com/apkinstall/apk?uid=4396060) which helps to crack the WPS
Pin to retrieve the WPA2 passphrase.
5.After installation of reaver app, launch it and do an on-screen comfirmation, which is, comfirmint that you're not using 
it for illegal purpose, then tap the APN or access poin you'd wish to crack and continue. Most times, you might need to verify
monitor mode to proceed, and this would cause the bcmon to open again.
6.Verify your settings and also make sure that you've checked the Automatic Advanced settings" box.
7.Finally, start cracking process by tapping start attack, at this final stage, it can take 2-10hrs for the cracking of WPS
to be successful.
Happy hacking. :P

1.make sure your android phone have a Broadcom bcm4329 or bcm 4330 chipest.
2.Then download and install bcmon{https://code.google.com/p/bcmon/downloads/detail?name=bcmon.apk}, it's essential because 
it helps monitor mode on your broadcom chipest that helps in the PIN Cracking.
3.After installation, run the app and tap "monitor mode" option
4.Then tap the "Run bcmon terminal" option and type "airodump-ng" and Enter. Once the airodump loads finish, you would 
be directed to the prompt command in which you're to type "airodump-ng wlan0" then tap the Enter button.
5.In this stage, a Mac address would appear, in which you're to jot dow.
6.Start scanning the channel by collecting information from the access point before attempting to crack the password,
then type, "airodump-ng -cchannel#--bssidMAC address-w output ath0" and tap enter, then it would start scanning, try
scanning till it reaches 20,000 - 30,000 packets.
Data usage- Not sure if needed but the devolopers gave the soft for free so It maybe is needed.
7.To finally crack the password, return to the terminal, but make sure you've reached the suitable number of packets,
then type "aircrack-ng output*.cap" and tap enter at the terminal.
8.Once the password is cracked successfully, you would recieve a message alerting, 'Key Found' and would display the key 
in hexidecimal form. So when entering the key, make sure you eliminate the dots '.' or double dots ':', i.e if it displays
12:34:56:78:90, then enter 1234567890 as the code.
P:S = The use of osmino wifi app seems to be the best any easiest method when hacking into a wifi network. Actually,
it doesn't do any hacking but it serve as help to retrieve the already hacked password by someone else. 
It also tracks down the location of such vulnerability and gets connected it's network.

Thanks for reading.Hope you enjoyed the read and thanks for being here and being desepointed and I know 
I spelled may words wrong but who cares.Devil may care.Oh I think I gotta make a skin with "Fuchka ya people" 
on it. Happy new year. :P
